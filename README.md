### **My Lua Scripts for REAPER DAW!**

**Warning!**
I am not a professional programmer, I want to learn in the future, but now sometimes my decisions in the code can be strange. But I pay great attention to the quality of the scripts. All scripts are negative tested. The main thing is that it works :) Sometimes I may update scripts to improve code literacy as my knowledge grows. Also many scripts have settings at the beginning of the code, which sometimes significantly change how the script works. Click "Edit action" and see. Thank you for your attention to my scripts!
